# Welcome!

Here's how to begin this (very) short R for Beginners tutorial: 

1. Download R https://www.r-project.org/ 
2. Download RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 
3. In the top right-hand corner of this page, you'll see a green "Clone or Download" button. Go ahead and download the .zip file to your desktop and unzip it. 

Now from the file you just downloaded, open up `R-Lab-1-Introduction.Rmd` in RStudio (not with R!) and navigate to line 10. ðŸ‘‹
