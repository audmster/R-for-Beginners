# Welcome!

Here's how to begin this (very) short R for Beginners tutorial: 

- In the top right-hand corner, you'll see a green "Clone or Download" button. Go ahead and download the .zip file to your desktop and unzip it. 
- Download R https://www.r-project.org/ 
- Download RStudio https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 

Now from the file you just downloaded, open up `R-Lab-1-Introduction.Rmd` in RStudio and navigate to line 10. ðŸ‘‹
